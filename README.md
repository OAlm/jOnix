# jOnix Service

jOnix is a part of jOnix platform application which represents a REST service which can receive, check, store, and resend messages to other REST services. In order to consume the ONIX messages, the POST http method must be executed on the address of the service. It will automatically check for some of the ONIX rules, in order to prevent invalid ONIX messages. The service stores all the incoming data. Headers of ONIX messages are stored separately from ONIX product information. Versioning is supported, and on the product receival, a new version is stamped on the product data.

# Running the app

In order to run it, you need to install java EE runtime supporting java EE7 (tested on glassfish v8). Next, the mongoDB should be installed on localhost on port 27017. After that, run the maven build script, build a war, and install it into your application server. Requires a private key, which can be obtained from jOnix Client.

# Notes

Works with the jOnix client, so that service redirection can work. Moreover, without the private key, which can be generated by jOnix Client, the jOnix service will not allow any messages in.
